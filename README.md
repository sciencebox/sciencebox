### ScienceBox in a nutshell
ScienceBox allows for the deployment of CERN production services on premises by means of containers and orchestrators. It features:
- [EOS](https://eos-web.web.cern.ch/eos-web/) ~ Scalable distributed storage solution developed at CERN
- CERNBOX -- Work in Progress. Stay tuned!
- [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch/swan/) ~ The CERN platform to perform interactive data analysis in the cloud with Jupyter Notebooks
- [CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/) ~ A software distribution service to let SWAN use centrally-maintained software stacks
- Several satellite components (Identity provider, LDAP server, HTTP caches, ...) to glue services together for stand-alone deployments
